# odin-recipes

The task of this project was to build a basic recipe website. The finished website consists of a main index page which has links to three recipes. 

Skills demonstrated:

- **HTML markup**: I improved my knowledge on how to structure web pages using HTML, including the creation of headers, paragraphs, organized and unorganized lists.

- **Version Control with Git**: Throughout the project I have utilized Git for version control, enabling it to track changes and manage my project better.

- **Problem-Solving Skills**: By toubleshooting issues that arose during the development process I have improved my problem-solving skills through research and experimentation.

This project proved to be a good opportunity to apply some of my fundamental web development knowledge. It also proved as good practice in using linux base operating systems, namely Ubuntu. As all file creation, edits and deployment for this project was done through the Xubuntu console on a Ubuntu VM.
